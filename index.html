		<p>	Que onda, it's ya man, C-LOS! Age is just a mindset. Before this program started I was working
			as a medicinal herbal agriculturist. I would
			trim plants and compile packs of medicinal cannabis for patient use. I graduated from CNM with my degree in sociology
			and I didn't want to stop learning so I signed up for <a href = "https://www.deepdivecoding.com/" target = "_blank">Deep Dive Coding!</a>

			<h2>What I'm really about...</h2>
			<p>I grew up listening to <em>only</em> 3 genres of music- classic country, new age contemporary, and jazz to name a few.
				Artists that come to mind are people like <b>Willie Nelson</b>, <b>Enya</b>(lol), and <b>Miles Davis</b>.
			To get into the point, I have a general appreciation for art in general.
			Below is a list of art topics that interest me:
		</p>
			<ul>
				<li>music like soft jazz</li>
				<li>poetry by Dr. Seuss</li>
			<li>graphic design without the graphics</li>
			<li>films, such as spaghetti westerns & docudramas </li>
			</ul>
