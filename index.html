		<h1>Whaddup</h1>
		<p>	Hey, I'm Carlos! I'm 22 years old. Before this program started I was working
			for a medical cannabis dispensary for about a year. I would
			trim and package the cannabis. I graduated from CNM with my degree in sociology
			in 2017 and wanted to do something more.

			<h2>Interests</h2>
		<p>I grew up listening to different genres of music- soft rock, r&b, and hip-hop to name a few.
			Artists that come to mind are people like Erykah Badu, Kelly Clarkson (lol), and Alicia Keys.
			To get into the point, I have interests in music, poetry, graphic design, and film, mostly.
			I have a general appreciation for art in general.
